### How to install a color theme extension in VSCode

1. Click the `Extensions` icon on the left tab menu.

2. Enter the name of the color theme extension in the top search bar that says "Search Extensions in Marketplace"

### How to switch color themes

Shortcut on MacOS: `Cmd`+`K`+`T`

Shortcut on Windows: `Ctrl`+`K`+`T`

A dropdown should appear where you can quick select a color theme.

## Fonts

These are some great fonts to try. JetBrains Mono and Hack look pretty similar in my opinion, so I sometimes switch between the two.

- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
- [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/)
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

### How to change your font in VSCode

1. Navigate to your global VSCode settings. The shortcut on MacOS is `Cmd`+`,`.

2. Under `Commonly Used` > `Editor: Font Family`, enter the font family you would like to use at the start of the comma-separated list of strings.
