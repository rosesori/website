This website was made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) theme for Hugo by [CaiJimmy](https://github.com/CaiJimmy). Hugo is a fast static site generator written in Go. The content is written in Markdown files, which Hugo processes and transforms into a fully functional website.
